This is Ethereal, my latest, greatest, and quite possibly most unique template for HTML5 UP.
Since releasing Parallelism 3-4 years ago (!!!), I've been dying to do another side-scrolling
template with more in the way of flexibility/customization potential. The result is this template,
Ethereal, which combines a robust side-scrolling framework of my own creation (with various
"scroll-assist" features like drag/momentum scrolling, keyboard shortcuts, etc.) with a unique
look and feel, a lightbox gallery, tons of customization options, and, of course, full
responsiveness. Hope you dig it :)
